# Week 2 Exercise - MongoDB & Node.js (Driver Data Management)

## ðŸ“„ Overview
This project is part of the Week 2 Exercise for the Database Programming subject. It demonstrates how to perform basic **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using **Node.js** and **MongoDB** to manage driver data.

## ðŸš€ Tasks Completed

### âœ… Task 1
**Define Drivers as a JavaScript Variable**

## ðŸ’¡ Lab Report

### 1. Explain what is CRUD operations and how it is relates to the mongo functions in
the exercise.
### 2. Identify all the mongo operators used in the exercise, then explain the usage for
each.
### 3. Replace the mongo functions in Task 5 to updateMany instead of updateOne,
compare the diFerence based on the result in console and the mongo compass.
### 4. Replace the mongo functions in Task 6 to deleteMany instead of deleteOne,
compare the diFerence based on the result in console and the mongo compass.

Submission Requirements
